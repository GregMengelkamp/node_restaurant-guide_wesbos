## This is code done by following along 'Learn Node' from Wes Bos

This course is advertised, sold and meant as a premium training for Node.js, Express and MongoDB and it didn't disappoint.
It takes a comprehensible input approach to teaching and sucessively implements and details out new features. Starting with the bascics you indeed end up with a fullstack app.
It helped me a ton to wrap my head around the information flow and the design of such an app while always encouraging best practices when writing the code.
I will cover parts of this project or rather my take on parts of this project I found most interesting or insightful in the stories sections of my personal website soon.

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command:
npm run sample

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

| Name          | Email (login)      | Password |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Wes Bos       | wes@example.com    | wes      |
| Debbie Downer | debbie@example.com | debbie   |
| Beau          | beau@example.com   | beau     |

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:
npm run blowitallaway
